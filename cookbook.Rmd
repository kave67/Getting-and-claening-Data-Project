## Details 
This cookbook contains the deatils about the variables, data and transformation on the data appled for this assignment.

### Source 
Data are fetched from the link provied in the course site. The entire data resides in the UCI Machine learning Repository

### Dataset Information
The dataset is created involvng 30 persons in the age group of 19 to 48 years and observes the six actvities performed by these indivduals with wearable computing devices/apps within smart devices such as smartphone( only smartphones in this study). The considered six activites are WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.  the observed data in this study are based on  3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.

The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

### Information on the variables
 1.Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
 2.Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope
 3.A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables
 4.Its activity label
 5.An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
