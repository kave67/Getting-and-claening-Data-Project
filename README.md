# Getting-and-claening-Data-Project
### week 4 assignment coursera - R programming

## OVERVIEW
The purpose of this project to test the level of understaanding and utlizing the learning component.
he goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
A full description of the data used in this project can be found at 'The UCI Machine Learning Repository

Creating a cookbook that contains information on the variables, data set, transformations and work that was done to tidy up the data
'run_analysis.R' is the code for the R script used to complete the project

### Instructions to be adopted
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
